# Unlocking Llama
Llama is a collection of pre-trained Llama large language models released by Meta AI.  It encompasses models ranging from 7 billion to 70 billion parameters.

Here we've provided an implementation of the Large Language Model Llama 2 7b. 

1. Llama 2 model with 7B parameters is already hosted on Replicated and we will access this model models through API.
2. You need to register on replicate and generate an API-Key.
3. We use Streamlit to create an interactive app for the Large Language Model Llama.

# Ethical Considerations
The use of Generative AI (GenAI) based on pre-trained large language models (LLMs) can influence a number of ethical issues related to misinformation, copyright, privacy, and transparency.

Perhaps the most important issues to address are the risk levels and transparency. The current LLMs search for correlation, not causality. To build trust in these models, we need to understand how and why LLMs generate their outputs, and we should incorporate subject matter experts judgment at appropriate development stages.

Until that level of trustworthiness have been reached, we may not want to rely on GenAI outputs that could have a negative impact on individuals or organizations.
