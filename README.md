# Unlocking Llama
Llama is a collection of pre-trained Llama large language models released by Meta AI.  It encompasses models ranging from 7 billion to 70 billion parameters.

Here we've provided an implementation of the Large Language Model Llama 2 7b.

# Ethical Considerations
The use of pre-trained large language models (LLMs) can influence a number of ethical issues related to misinformation, copyright, privacy, and transparency.

Perhaps the most important issues to address are the risk levels and transparency. The current GenAI models search for correlation, not causality. To build trust in these models, we need to understand how and why GenAI models generate
their outputs, and we should incorporate subject matter experts judgment at appropriate development stages.

Until that level of trustworthiness have been reached, we may not want to rely on GenAI outputs that could have a negative impact on individuals or organizations.
